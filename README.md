# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project does not work with node@16, downgrading to node@10 should resolve the issue

This is the current live build. However, we're migrating to Next.js. Please checkout the next branch for more information. Using the project in the next branch will not require a separate backend deployment (it's written and managed in the same project).

The major reason next branch haven't replaced the master branch is because Lab.js migration hasn't been completed. Lab.js used in the master branch a very rough port of the vanilla javascript packages.
